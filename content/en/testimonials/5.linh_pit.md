You created a ceremony for us that couldn’t have been more beautiful, personal, and emotional.
A wedding ceremony is one of the most meaningful moments of the entire day, and you turned it into something truly special for us.
Your words and the atmosphere you created touched not only our hearts but also moved our guests deeply. So many people shed tears during the ceremony – from emotion, joy, and a sense of connection.  

We are especially grateful that, thanks to the Vietnamese part, my family was able to fully experience the ceremony. It was so moving to see them truly feel like a part of it. You didn’t just translate – you created a heartfelt and sensitive wedding speech in both languages. That is something truly special.   

There are not many bilingual German–Vietnamese wedding speakers out there. That’s why we value your work even more. Your surprise gift touched us deeply – it was so thoughtful and full of love, we absolutely didn’t expect that. We also want to thank you for always replying quickly and reliably during the preparation process. That gave us a lot of peace of mind and trust during an already emotional time.  

We wholeheartedly recommend you to any future couple.
