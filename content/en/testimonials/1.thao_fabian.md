Dear Nguyen,

A heartfelt thank you for your loving guidance at our wedding ceremony. Since we had both German and Vietnamese guests, we wanted a bilingual wedding—not only for the ceremony itself but also for all speeches and contributions throughout the evening. You helped translate every speech and contribution, making sure all our guests felt included in the celebration.

You supported us not only on our wedding day from beginning to end but also throughout the entire preparation process. You patiently answered all our questions, accommodated our wishes, coordinated with all service providers, and on the wedding day, you were not only there for us but also a reliable point of contact for all our guests.

During the ceremony, you found beautiful words that truly reflected us and our story. You ensured that every speech and contribution was translated, allowing all our guests to be part of the celebration. And finally, you didn’t just lead the wedding ceremony but also accompanied and translated all the speeches throughout the evening.

We are incredibly grateful that you were by our side and that you brought our vision of a bilingual wedding to life so wonderfully. ❤️
