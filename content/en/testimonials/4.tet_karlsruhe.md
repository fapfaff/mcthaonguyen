The Tết Event 2025 was extremely professional and successful, and a significant part of this success is due to Thảo Nguyên, who hosted the entire event. You did a great job in making the program engaging and capturing the emotions of the audience beautifully. My friends who attended were thrilled and asked: “Where did you find such a great presenter?”. That really is a great compliment for you!

But you didn't just shine as a presenter - you are also an incredibly pleasant and reliable partner to work with. Thanks to your support, the event organization ran smoothly. I was particularly impressed by the reel you created to convey the importance of the event - a real highlight for our public relations work.

What I particularly appreciate about you is your sense of responsibility. Despite your busy schedule, you didn't shy away from the long journey to support us in Karlsruhe. Thanks to you, we were able to organize a Tết festival together, which was a great success.

Thank you for being such a valuable part of our team, for accompanying us for three months and for creating a heartfelt project for the Vietnamese community from scratch!
