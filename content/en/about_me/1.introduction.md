Hello there,

I'm Thảo Nguyên, a bilingual MC, event host, and wedding speaker (German-English-Vietnamese) based in Germany. From a young age, I had a deep passion for the microphone and even worked as an MC in Vietnam. Fortunately, I now have the opportunity to pursue this passion in Germany.

As a wedding speaker, I see every love story as a unique emotional journey, and it brings me great joy to share these stories during the ceremony. I frequently host multicultural weddings between German-Vietnamese or Vietnamese couples in Germany, ensuring that both the couple and their guests can fully experience and connect with the heartfelt emotions of the celebration in both languages. Whether you are planning a wedding in a "Vietnamese" or "Western" style, I would love to help make your big day truly special.

Beyond weddings, I also offer bilingual hosting services for various events, ensuring a seamless experience for you and your guests at weddings, birthdays, gala evenings, or other festive occasions.
From weddings and birthday celebrations to formal events such as galas and ceremonies, I am always ready to accompany you.

Feel free to explore my website and leave me a message. I look forward to being part of your special events!
