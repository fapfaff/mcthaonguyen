## Relevant Legal Bases  

**Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:** Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the GDPR regulations, national data protection provisions may apply in your or our country of residence. If specific legal bases apply in individual cases, we will inform you about them in this privacy policy.  

*   **Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)** - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.  
*   **Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or to take pre-contractual measures at the request of the data subject.  
*   **Legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c) GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.  
*   **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)** - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not override these interests.  
*   **Processing special categories of personal data related to healthcare, profession, and social security (Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h) GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for purposes of preventive healthcare or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity of employees, for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment in the healthcare or social sector, or for managing healthcare or social services and systems.  

**National data protection regulations in Germany:** In addition to the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany, particularly the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and automated decision-making including profiling. Additionally, state-specific data protection laws may apply.  

**Note on GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG):** This privacy policy serves to inform under both the Swiss DSG and the GDPR. For broader applicability and clarity, the terminology of the GDPR is used. However, the legal meaning of terms is still determined by the Swiss DSG when applicable.  

## Security Measures  

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.  

Measures include securing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data through control of physical and electronic access, as well as access rights, input, transmission, availability, and separation of data. Additionally, we have implemented procedures to safeguard data subject rights, data deletion, and responses to data threats.  

**Securing online connections via TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS):** To protect users’ data transmitted through our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This ensures secure and encrypted data transmission.  

## Provision of Online Services and Web Hosting  

We process users' data to provide our online services. To this end, we process users' IP addresses, which are necessary to deliver the content and functions of our online services to the users' browsers or devices.  

*   **Processed Data Types:** Usage data (e.g., page visits, duration of stay, click paths, interaction with content and functions); meta, communication, and procedural data (e.g., IP addresses, timestamps, request logs).  
*   **Affected Persons:** Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).  
*   **Purposes of Processing:** Provision of our online services and user-friendliness; IT infrastructure; security measures.  
*   **Legal Bases:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).  

Further details about processing procedures, methods, and services are included in the full privacy policy.
