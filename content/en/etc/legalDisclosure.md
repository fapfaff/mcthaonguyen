## Disclaimer
### Liability for Content
The content of our website has been created with the greatest possible care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws (§ 7 para. 1 TMG).

According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the moment we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

### Limitation of Liability for External Links
Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content.

The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No illegal content was identifiable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this website are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.

Where content on this site has not been created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we kindly ask for a corresponding notification. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.
